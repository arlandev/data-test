## Docker and Airflow Setup

I was able to set up an Airflow Environment on Docker by simply following the available documentation on Apache Airflow's website! The documentation can be found [here](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/howto/docker-compose/index.html).

I used the same Neon table connection, which is a serverless PostgreSQL Database service.

I added my tiktok_pipeline.py DAG file in this folder for visibility purposes.

Thanks!
