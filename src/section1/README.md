# Hello! This document serves as a general overview of how I tackled this section.

## Ingestion and Transformation

I created a single file for both functionalities of ingestion and transformation.

## Loading

I created a separate file to create the functionalities of pushing data to the table so that there's no unrelated code mingling with one another.

## Entire process

I tied it all up with a main.py file to be able to run it all in one go!

# I deleted the table in the .env file so no need to worry! Thanks!
